            We live in a pluralistic society, a relatively new yet irreversible reality. Since the 2000s, Germany has begun to recognize itself as an <i>immigrant country</i>. According to 2023 statistics, about 27% of Germans have an immigrant background, and 13.9 million foreigners reside in Germany. But how do these newcomers perceive and question the German society they experience in this post-digital age?</p>

            <p class="title">A Society of<br>Migrant Workers<br>Who Stayed</p>

            <p class="start">As the 2000s passed, Germany began to recognize itself as an "immigrant country." Although Germany had already brought in a large number of migrant workers in the 1960s, society at the time thought of foreign workers as people who would eventually leave. However, Germany continued to accept immigrants thereafter. While economic necessity sometimes prompted the active recruitment of immigrants, social changes like the collapse of Eastern Europe and the birth of the European Union also led to population movements. Refugees also became part of the immigrant society. Currently, about 27% of the German population has an immigrant background, including both first-generation immigrants and their descendants. Germany's acknowledgment of itself as an immigrant country signifies many things. On one hand, this self-admission recognizes that German society cannot function without immigrants and that good policies are needed to continue accepting and living together with them. 
            </p>

            <p class="big">German media often cite a phrase from Swiss writer Max Frisch when discussing immigrant societies: “We called for labor power, but human beings came.” It may sound theoretical, but it is a very realistic statement. No one wants to be mere labor power fulfilling others’ needs. Refugees are no exception. Life after survival is also important, and if society fails to find appropriate answers to this, the entire society may face difficulties.</p>
                
            <p class="normal">In this article, we will cover different groups of immigrants who have come to Germany for various reasons from the 1960s to the present. While we will explore changes in Germany's immigration policies and social awareness over the years, we also aim to address the desires, emotions, and struggles of immigrants.</p>

            <p class="title2">The Present of the Ruhr Region,<br>Home to Many Immigrants</p>

            <p class="start">We first arrived in Germany in May 2012. My partner and I flew from Incheon to Frankfurt via Shanghai, a journey of about 17 hours, on the most affordable route available. We had to travel further by train. Despite the hot weather, the air conditioning on the ICE, Germany's high-speed train, was not working. Although tickets and seat reservations for German trains were separate, we only realized this after boarding. There were no seats for people like us, unfamiliar with the German system, on the crowded train. After a little over two hours, the train arrived in Bochum. Practical reasons like low living costs and a good language school made it our destination. I knew nothing about this city and did not consider it our final destination in Germany. We attended the language school and lived in its affiliated dormitory. The school was in a quiet, modest residential area slightly away from the center. It took time to perceive this desolate and unfamiliar neighborhood, with nothing but houses, as a quiet and modest space. A ten-minute tram ride would take us to what could be considered downtown, but it did not feel bustling. I gradually grew accustomed to the declining city and learned more about it. </p>

            <p class="start">The Ruhr region, where Bochum is located, was a representative coal and steel industrial area of West Germany. <br> Although Bochum's last coal mine closed in 1973, the city’s image remained tied to mining. Bochum has the world's largest mining museum, and there are numerous guided tours and museums in the Ruhr area that allow visitors to experience tunnels. Despite being one of Germany's most populous regions, the Ruhr was neither sleek nor vibrant. Contrary to my expectations of Germany, a diverse mix of ethnicities lived here. Over time, I learned that many Korean immigrants live in the Ruhr, with Korean churches and schools. The Ruhr was the land of Korean miners dispatched to Germany.<br>
                In December 1963, 243 Korean miners arrived in the Ruhr. From 1963 to 1977, approximately 8,000 Korean men came to work in coal mines in Germany. The agreement between Germany and Korea regarding the dispatch of miners was ostensibly for “supporting Korea's technological development” and “expanding the professional capabilities of Korean miners.” The dispatched workers signed three-year labor contracts. However, few had experience working in mines in Korea. Poor employment prospects in Korea, family support, and a spirit of ambitious challenge led them to Germany. The underground work sites were as unfamiliar as Germany itself. Most of them would later engage in different professions.
            </p>

            <p class="title3">Germany's Call for ‘Guest Workers’<br>to Maintain Low-Wage,<br>High-Intensity Industries</p>

            <p class="start">When Germany first became a modern nation-state in 1871, the Ruhr, with its coal deposits, played a central role in Germany’s industrialization. The coal mines required more labor as demand increased. Migrant workers were called in. The foreign group that represented the Ruhr until just before World War I was Polish immigrants. At one point, they accounted for over 60% of miners. Speaking a different language, they formed their own enclaves within the city, with their clubs, newspapers, labor unions, and banks. However, after World War I, two-thirds of them left Germany, and the remaining ones assimilated as native residents of the Ruhr.As West Germany’s economy grew post-World War II, coal mines once again needed migrant workers. The entire industry faced a labor shortage. </p>

            <p class="normal2">As West Germany’s economy grew post-World War II, coal mines once again needed migrant workers. The entire industry faced a labor shortage. <p class="big">On December 20, 1955, the German government signed its first worker recruitment agreement with Italy. Italian workers initially worked in agriculture and construction before being deployed to various heavy industries. Germany signed similar agreements with Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, and other countries, leading to the arrival of “guest workers” (Gastarbeiter) in Germany.
            </p></p>

            <p class="normal">Originally, the term for migrant workers in Germany was "Fremdarbeiter," combining the word "fremd," meaning foreign or strange, with "Arbeiter," meaning worker. However, this term was associated with forced labor during the Nazi era. To erase this uncomfortable past, post-World War II West Germany adopted the term "guest worker." Yet, they did not treat migrant workers kindly as guests. They perceived them as temporary labor providers who would eventually leave, and in that sense, they were guests.

                Guest workers had to pass health checks to come to Germany, ensuring they were free from contagious diseases and physically strong. Most of them worked in environments with few Germans or only supervisors, in jobs that Germans avoided. Initially, they lived in temporary wooden barracks. While they were guests, they were kept separate from Germans.
                </p>

            <p class="normal4">German society produced a discriminatory gaze by perceiving migrant workers as a distinct group separate from their daily lives. Until the mid-1960s, the most numerous migrant workers, Italians, were seen as disorderly, hot-tempered children or playboys. Some discos and pubs even had signs saying “No dogs or Italians allowed.” While some individuals showed goodwill and interest towards strangers, society continuously indicated that they did not belong. For migrant workers from Italy and other Mediterranean countries, train stations were gathering places on weekends, symbolizing a connection to their homeland. Dressed neatly, they met at train stations every weekend. Often, migrant workers socialized among themselves, sharing their cultural events and food. In a foreign land with unfamiliar language and culture, it was natural for people from the same hometown to gather, but it also happened because native residents did not want to mingle with strangers.<br>
                Turkish writer Nevzat Üstün wrote that Germans wanted to bring guest workers in the morning and send them back home in the evening. Germany did not pay for the upbringing of young and healthy foreign children but used them as labor. Thanks to guest workers, Germany maintained low-wage, high-intensity industries that were no longer sustainable domestically, contributing to stable economic growth. Therefore, Germany welcomed migrant workers as labor.<br>
                Armando Rodrigues, a carpenter from Portugal who arrived in Cologne in 1964, was celebrated as the official one-millionth guest worker, receiving a small motorcycle and a bouquet from the German government as a surprise gift.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">However, Rodrigues’ immigration story was not successful. He returned to Portugal after being diagnosed with cancer. Although he was entitled to sick leave benefits from the German health insurance system, no one informed him. His savings in Germany were eventually depleted by hospital bills. He died in 1979 at the age of 53. The small motorcycle he received is displayed at the history museum in Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. His death, excluded from the public insurance system, is also recorded by someone.
                Despite these hardships, it is not accurate to say that the lives of migrant workers in Germany were miserable. Rodrigues described Germany as the “land of money.” The countries that signed labor recruitment agreements with Germany mostly faced high unemployment, and wages in Germany were significantly higher than in their home countries. Migrant workers could support their families back home and still save enough. Since many worked in large enterprises, their pay environment was stable. In 1972, 41% of migrant workers worked in companies with over 500 employees, compared to about 25% of Germans.
            </p>

            <p class="normal">However, migrant workers generally worked in low-wage, non-educational fields, so their pay levels were not high. To overcome this disparity, many volunteered for hazardous or dirty jobs that offered “special allowances” and worked more overtime. In 1972, 36% of migrant workers with a 186-hour monthly contract worked over 200 hours, and 20% worked over 220 hours. As a result, the average wage of migrant workers in 1972 was similar to that of Germans.</p>

            <p class="title2">Workers Who Did Not Remain Guests, Forming a Significant Portion of the German Population</p>

            <p class="start">German politicians and media began openly acknowledging that Germany was an immigrant country only in the 2000s. It took a long time for Germany to recognize itself as such. The story of Germany as an immigrant country began with guest workers, and it was possible because their narratives did not end as guests. As of 2021, people with immigrant backgrounds made up 27% of the German population, about 22 million people. Among them, the largest group was Turkish-Germans, numbering 2.75 million, whose history also began as guest workers. Similarly, 920,000 Italians in Germany started as guest workers. The population of Korean descent in Germany is also about 50,000.</p>

            <p class="normal">In his photo essay “The Seventh Man,” which documents the lives of foreign workers in Europe, John Berger states that most who came as migrant workers and settled in a new country remain unsure of their decision. He describes that while some make firm decisions for a more stable life through permanent settlement, most say, “It’s too late to go back now.” As Berger suggests, the settlement of immigrants involves continuous self-doubt about whether they belong to the society and whether the society accepts them as part of it. This self-doubt appears repeatedly in writings about first-generation migrant workers in Germany and even about their children.<br> This uncertainty does not mean that their lives are passive. Surviving in a foreign country always requires significant adventure and effort, which involves remarkable proactivity. The lives of those I met were also like this. The miners’ lives continued beyond the end of the tunnels, and staying required challenges. Some pursued vocational training to work in major German companies, others obtained PhDs, opened Korean restaurants when most Germans knew little about Korea, or worked for Korean companies and students in Germany.
            </p>

            <p class="big">It took several years after coming to Germany to realize that the Turks, Mediterranean Europeans, and other immigrant groups who now form the largest proportion of immigrants had come to Germany through similar routes as Koreans in the 1960s and 1970s. The elderly Italian couple who lived in the attic below us for almost 30 years had once rented our attic to raise their children. Later, we moved to a ground-floor house in another city, where a Portuguese grandfather lived upstairs, and he had also raised his children there. Yet, while living close to them, I did not realize they were guest workers like the Koreans.
            </p>

            <p class="normalend">Researching guest workers, I was surprised by the many similarities between different immigrant groups. Their diligence in doing jobs Germans avoided, frugality to support families back home, experiences of racism, stories of opening Italian, Spanish, Greek, Turkish, and Korean restaurants or grocery stores, and narratives of their children integrating well into society through higher education. Perhaps many immigrants of different nationalities living in Korea today are creating similar stories.</p>
